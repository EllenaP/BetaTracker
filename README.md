This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Install Node.js first if you haven't already!!! 

You want Ionic 2 or 3, NOT Ionic 1. Ionic 1 should not automatically install unless you specifically tell it to. 

Ionic will typically moan if you dont have the necessary installations (corvoda, node.js, etc. when you try to install Ionic).

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

To Start a new Ionic project, cd to your desired directory then:

```
$ ionic start aNiceAppName 
```

You will be given a set of starter options, such as "tabs", "sidebar", "blank". 


For verisoning:

```bash
$ ionic info
```
To run your app in the browser (ctrl + C will end the server):
```bash
$ ionic serve
```
To run your app in the special fancy Ionic browser view:
```bash
$ ionic serve -l
```
